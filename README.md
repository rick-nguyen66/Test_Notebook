# Your Project Title

A brief sentence describing what this project and the notebook do.

*Example:* This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`analysis.ipynb`) demonstrating data analysis and visualization using Pandas, Seaborn, SciPy, and Matplotlib, with dependencies managed by Poetry.

## Quick Start

Follow these steps to run the notebook locally.

### Prerequisites

*   [Python 3.7+](https://www.python.org/)
*   [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
*   [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)

### Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
    cd your-repository-name
    ```
    *(Replace placeholders with your actual details)*

2.  **Install dependencies with Poetry:**
    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```
    This command reads `pyproject.toml`, creates a virtual environment, and installs all required packages (Pandas, Seaborn, SciPy, Matplotlib, JupyterLab, ipykernel, etc.).

3.  **Register Jupyter Kernel (Optional but Recommended):**
    This helps Jupyter and VS Code find your project's environment.
    ```bash
    poetry run python -m ipykernel install --user --name your-project-name --display-name "Python (Your Project Name)"
    ```
    *(Choose a name for your kernel, often your project/repo name)*

### Running the Notebook

Choose your preferred method:

*   **In Browser (Jupyter Lab):**
    1.  Launch from the terminal: `poetry run jupyter lab`
    2.  Open `your_notebook_name.ipynb` in your browser.
    3.  Ensure the correct kernel is selected (e.g., "Python (Your Project Name)" from Step 3) under `Kernel -> Change kernel...`.

*   **In VS Code:**
    1.  Open the project folder in VS Code.
    2.  Make sure the [Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) is installed.
    3.  Open `your_notebook_name.ipynb`.
    4.  In the top-right, click the kernel selector and choose your Poetry environment (look for the path or the name you used in Step 3).

## Notes

*   Project dependencies are defined in `pyproject.toml` and locked with exact versions in `poetry.lock`. Both files should be committed to Git.
*   The virtual environment created by Poetry (often in `.venv/`) is automatically ignored by Git via the included `.gitignore` file.
